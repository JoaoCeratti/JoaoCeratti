## ðŸ‘‹ Hello there!

My name is JoÃ£o Ceratti,

I'm a software developer, currently working with Ruby on Rails and PostgreSQL.

I'm a Systems Analysis and Development student, currently in my penultimate year at university. I also have experience with other languages and frameworks such as Python, RobotFramework, C and other languages used in my studies.

I have knowledge in Cyber Security, mainly as a hobby, working with OS like Kali Linux and tools such as THC Hydra, Metasploit Framework, and Nmap to perform pentests on services, for instance, on platforms like TryHackMe.

On GitHub, you can find some of my personal projects, including Arduino projects, service automation, APIs in Rails, and others.

You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joao-ceratti-ba20392b0/) .
